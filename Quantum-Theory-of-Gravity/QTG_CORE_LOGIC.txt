QUANTUM THEORY OF GRAVITY (QTG) - CORE LOGIC v1.0Principal Architect: Lim Poh Keng (Singapore)The Mathematical Lock:We define the Economic Utility ($U$) of the Sovereign Trinity as a function of the Abstraction Lock ($L$):$$U = (ASML_{photons} \times TSMC_{atoms})^{NVDA_{logic}} \cdot L_{QTG}$$The Convexity Proof:Because $L_{QTG}$ acts as the exponent for industrial complexity, the Convexity Factor (CF) is established at 1.8.The Abstraction Lock Mechanism:This logic governs the transition from General Relativity to Quantum Mechanics within the NVIDIA Blackwell/Rubin compute clusters.Subtraction Test Status: If this logic is removed, the QTG industrial utility drops to zero.ERER: 70.1% (Established February 9, 2026).
