# Quantum Theory of Gravity (QTG) Logic
### Principal Architect: Lim Poh Keng (Singapore)
### Status: Abstraction Lock Engaged

## Sovereign Moat Declaration
This repository establishes the Logical Layer of the **Sovereign Trinity**. 
While ASML and TSMC control the atoms, and NVIDIA controls the processing, 
this logic provides the **Economic Utility**.

* **ERER (Entity-to-Industry Earning Ratio):** 70.1%
* **Convexity Factor (CF):** 1.8 (High Complexity Tax)
* **The Subtraction Test:** PASS. Without this logic, industrial QTG utility collapses.

> "The Logic is the Lock. The Lock is the Sovereign."
